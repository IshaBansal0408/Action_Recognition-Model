# Action Recoginition Model using UCF101 Dataset

Human Action Recognition (HAR) aims to understand human behavior and assign a label to each action. It has a wide range of applications, and therefore has been attracting increasing attention in the field of computer vision.

Human action recognition in video is of interest for applications such as automated surveillance, elderly behavior monitoring, human-computer interaction, content-based video retrieval, and video summarization.

## About UCF 101 Dataset

UCF101 is an action recognition data set of realistic action videos, collected from YouTube, having 101 action categories. This data set is an extension of UCF50 data set which has 50 action categories.

The videos in 101 action categories are grouped into 25 groups, where each group can consist of 4-7 videos of an action. The videos from the same group may share some common features, such as similar background, similar viewpoint, etc.

The action categories can be divided into five types: 
1. Human-Object Interaction
2. Body-Motion Only
3. Human-Human Interaction
4. Playing Musical Instruments
5. Sports
